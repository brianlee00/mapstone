Dev10 Capstone - Urban Development Map

App/Team name: Cyburbia

Team Members: Ryjll Morris, Brian Lee, Stephen Yale

What is it?
Our application will provide a way to track development projects using an interactive map. Users will be able to see real estate development projects that are proposed, under construction, and completed. A user will be able to view projects on the map, where clicking on a location pin will pull up more information. Admins will be able to add, edit, and delete projects as necessary. 

Projects will contain a location (address, city, state), a developer (will exist as a separate class with full CRUD operability), a square footage, a type (residential, industrial, commercial, recreational, etc.), a status (proposed, in progress, completed), and a brief description. 

What problem does this solve?
This application will be a resource for urban planners, local elected officials, real estate development professionals, and citizens to stay informed about developments occurring in their area. The lifecycle of development projects can be long and confusing, so it is beneficial for everyone to have a complete database that can connect projects to places and help people understand where things are happening and how they are related to other places. Admins, most likely professional planners and/or city officials, can update projects as their scope changes throughout the course of the development process.

Tech stack in use: Java, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap/Bootswatch, React

Learning Goal: Mapping API (Mapbox, Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)

Projected milestones during development: 
Diagram tables and relationships in SQL
Projects, Locations, Developers, possibly more
Define models
Projects, Locations, Developers, etc.
Build/test data repositories for each model
Build/test service layers for each model
Build/test controllers to define HTTP interaction
Build React components to render UI
Incorporate Mapping API to display projects on a map
Import and/or define icons and colors to customize the map
